# Street Dog Care Reporting System

The Street Dog Care Reporting System is a web-based platform designed to empower individuals to contribute to street dog welfare efforts in their local communities. Through this platform, users can report feeding activities, incidents, and other relevant information to create a comprehensive map-based resource for street dog care.
 
## Features

Feeding Spot Reporting: Users can report feeding spots, providing details such as frequency of feeding, types of food provided, and additional notes.
Incident Reporting: Users can report incidents such as dog accidents, injuries, or health concerns, including location, description, and severity.
Status Updates: Users can update the status of feeding spots or incidents to indicate if they're ongoing, resolved, or need assistance, with the ability to add comments or notes.
Community Engagement: Users can engage with the community by commenting on or reacting to feeding spots and incident reports, as well as sharing tips, resources, and support.
Notification System: A notification system alerts users about new feeding spots, incidents in their area, or updates on existing reports, with customizable notification preferences.
